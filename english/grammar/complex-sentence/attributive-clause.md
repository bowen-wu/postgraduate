- 翻译为: *...的名词*
- **先行词**: 定语从句所修饰的名词
- **关系词**: 引出定语从句的连接词
    - 作用1: 引导
    - 作用2: 替代 => **关系词在定语从句中充当成分，它替代了从句中跟先行词一样的成分**
        - This is *a skill* <u>**that** will help them all throughout life</u>.
        - 主句: This is **a skill**.
        - 从句: **A skill** will help them all throughout life.
- 定语从句的关系词在从句中**作成分**，且所做成分与先行词相同 => **关系词 == 先行词**

### 定语从句写法
