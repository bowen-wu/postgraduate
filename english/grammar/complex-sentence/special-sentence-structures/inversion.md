  recent events in Europe. ...在欧洲近来发生的事件中，它在连接不同民族和思想方面发挥了如此重要的作用
    - 正常语序: ...it has never served before...

    - 否定副词 not only 提前

#### only 位于句首

only 位于句首（only后可以是词、词组、句子），句子要部分倒装，翻译为: **直到...才**

- <ins>Only recently(直到最近)</ins> **have they come** to see the vital part <ins>forests will have to play in *storing carbon(碳存储)*</ins>.

    - come to do 渐渐开始/意识到
        - come to see 逐渐意识到；开始明白

- <ins>Only recently</ins> **did linguists begin** the serious study of languages <ins>that were very different from their own</ins>.

#### 虚拟条件句省略 if

虚拟条件句省略if，从句要部分倒装（如果一个从句中只有一个动词be，则直接把它提前，即放到主语前），主句不变

- But **had Entergy kept** its word, that debate would be *beside the point(无关紧要的)*.
    - 正常语序: If Entergy had kept its word...
    - 虚拟条件句省略if
    - 将 Entergy had kept its word 变为一般疑问句 == had Entergy kept its word...
