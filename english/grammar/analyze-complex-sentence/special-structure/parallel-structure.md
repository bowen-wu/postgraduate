# Special Structure

## 平行结构

- 平行结构，又称"并列结构"，是多个词、词组或句子并列在一起，作同一个成分
- 平行并列的多个成分或多个句子之间有并列连词或并列连词的词组来连接（如果多个并列连词相同，只保留最后一个，前面替换为逗号），并且并列的多个成分往往是
  **词性相同**或**形式一致**的
- 平行结构（并列结构）有四类
    1. 名词（词组）的平行并列
    2. 动词（谓语动词、非谓语动词）的平行并列
    3. 介词短语的平行并列
    4. 句子的平行并列

### 名词（词组）的平行并列

### 动词（谓语动词、非谓语动词）的平行并列

- 平行并列的动词，不管是谓语动词还是非谓语动词，形式一定是一致的
