# Special Structure

特殊结构长难句：

- 把原本连贯的句子从中间断开，插入其他成分
- 句子中再套句子
- 多个成分或多个句子的平行并列

## 分裂结构

- 在句子中插入额外的成分，或把句中某些成分从原来的位置上移走，造成了一个连贯的句子分裂
- 方法：找到分裂结构并把句子还原成原本连贯的形式

### 插入式的分裂结构

- 同位语或插入语插入句子中间
- 非限定性定语从句或状语从句插入句子中间

#### 同位语、插入语造成的分裂结构

- 同位语是对前面名词的解释说明
- 插入语是插入句子中间的补充信息
- 分析句子时，不必纠结是插入语还是同位语，只需要知道它是插入的补充信息，造成了分裂结构，先去掉不看即可
