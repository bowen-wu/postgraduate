# Basic Structure

## 简化长难句

- 有些简单句会有很多修饰限定、补充说明的扩展成分，因此去掉扩展成分（即非核心成分），找到简单句核心才能看懂
- 简化句子方法：简单句的核心成分要保留，先看；扩展（非核心）成分，可以后看
- 简化句子是为了更方便快捷地看懂长难句，而不是要简化到最精简
- 去掉句子非核心的扩展成分时，一定要注意其完整性
    - Case: 介词短语不能只去掉介词，要把它后面接的宾语（名词、代词、动名词）一起去掉
    - 非谓语动词同理，不能只去掉 doing、done、to do，如果是及物动词就要后接宾语，如果有修饰的形容词、副词和介词短语，都要一起去掉
