## Break Down Complex Sentence

### Connectors

- 英语是"形合"的语言，即英语的句子之间想要连接，必须要在形式上加上一个连接词表示合并，并且通过连接词说明句子之间的关系，让人一目了然
- 能够断开长难句的连接词种类
    1. 并列连词: and, but, or...(用来连接并列句)
    2. 从属连词: because, if, while, although, as...(用来引导状语从句)
    3. 关系词: that, how, wh-(what, who, whom, which, whose, when, where, why, whether...)(用来引导名词性从句或定语从句)
- 断开长难句最主要的方法是依靠连接词
    - 从句开始: 连接词
    - 从句结束: 一般结束于三种位置
        1. 标点
        2. 下一个连接词
        3. 第二个谓语动词前
- -ed结尾的动词或动词的过去式和过去分词一样
    1. 如果意思是主动 => 谓语动词
    2. 如果意思是被动 => 非谓语动词

### 从句开始于连接词，结束于标点

- However, supporters of fake grass *point* out <ins>**that** there *is* also an environmental impact with natural lawns</ins>**,** <ins>**which** *need* mowing and therefore usually *consume* electricity or petrol</ins>.
    - 注: **并列句不完整则不能断开**
- Students also *benefit* from learning something about coding <ins>**before** they *get* to college</ins>**,** <ins>**where** introductory computer-science classes *are packed* to the brim</ins>**,** <ins>**which** *can drive* the less-experienced or -determined students away</ins>.

### 从句开始于连接词，结束于下一个连接词前

### 从句开始于连接词，结束于第二个谓语动词前

- 从句中只能有一个谓语动词，，所以从连接词开始往后数，第一个谓语动词是当前从句的，第二个则不是
- But anyone <ins>**who** *does not* have to *sell*</ins> *is keeping* away, waiting for confidence to return.
- In short, the image <ins>**that** best *represents* the current crisis</ins> *is* the stereotypical cartoon scene of a man sitting at the breakfast table with a newspaper held up in front of his face...

- <ins>**If** the bar exam *is* truly a stern enough test for a would-be lawyer</ins>**,** those <ins>who *can sit* it earlier</ins> *should be allowed* to do so.

### 补充

1. 如果连接词的前后不是句子（即没有谓语动词）则这个连接词无效，不需要从这里断开
    - Take a broader look at our species' place in the universe**,** and it becomes clear that we have an excellent chance of surviving for tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of years.
2. that 出现时，不一定可以用来断开句子，因为 that 除作连接词（引出从句）外，还可以做代词，表示"那个，那种"
    - On one hand, that viewpoint is a logical product of America's evolution.
