## 分析主谓

### 断开长难句只看谓语动词，不考虑非谓语动词

- 谓语动词是一件事的核心，且一件事中只能有唯一的一个谓语动词，因此既可以通过谓语动词的数量判断一个长难句中包含几件事，也可以通过谓语动词的位置帮助断开长难句
- Strangers are inherently unfamiliar to us, so we are more likely to feel anxious when communicating with them compared
  with our friends ard acquaintances.

### 先找从句，但先看主语

- 找，要先找从句；但看，要先看主句
- ...when we come to think back on it, we can't remember the journey well because we didn't pay much attention to it.

## 简化长难句

- 长难句:
    1. 多件事连接在一起
    2. 修饰限定补充说明的非核心扩展成分太多
- 解决基本结构的长难句: 断开(标点、连接词、分析主谓) + 简化(定位谓语动词，去扩展找核心)
- The same dramatic technological changes thant have provided marketers with more (and more diverse) communications
  choices have also increased the risk that passionate consumers will voice their opinions in quicker, more visible, and
  much more damaging ways.

## 特殊结构的分析长难句

### 解决分裂结构的关键是还原成连贯

- 解决分裂结构的关键就是先要把分裂的部分找到，然后把句子还原成原本连贯的形式，再进行长难句分析
- Work by Tina Malti, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto, suggests that guilt may compensate for am
  emotional deficiency.
- The new vaccine, which is different from the annual flu vaccine, is available ahead of expectations.

### 解决嵌套结构的关键是分层次

- 嵌套结构，就是大句子套小句子。首先，正常断开长难句；然后按照层次由外向内（或由内向外），逐层看懂句意
- Everybody wants to know how the people who will soon inhabit those empty office cubicles will differ from those who
  came before them.

### 解决平行结构的关键是理清多个并列

- 平行结构的特点是**各个成分之间词性相同且形式一致，并且通常有并列连词（和逗号）连接**
- 三步搞定平行结构
    1. 先找到并列连词
    2. 往后看: 确定平行并列的成分是什么词性或什么形式
    3. 往前找: 找到与之相同的词性或一致的形式，则找到平行并列的各个成分
- During the experiment, the social robot rat followed the living rats around, played with the same toys, and opened
  cage doors to let trapped rats escape.

### 综合

- As a linguist, he acknowledges that all varieties of human language, including non——standard ones like Black English,
  can be powerfully expressive——there exists no language or dialect in the world than cannot convey complex ideas.
- Young people who are still getting started in life were more likely than order adults to prioritize personal
  fulfillment in their work, to believe they will advance their careers most by regularly changing jobs, to favor
  communities with more public services and a faster pace of life, to agree that couples should be financially secure
  before getting married or having children, and to maintain that children are best served by two parents working
  outside the home...
