Dear friends,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;On behalf of the Students' Union of Beijing Foreign Studies University, I would like to extend
our heartfelt welcome to all the overseas students who will study in our university.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is my great pleasure to offer you several practical suggestions. In the first place, life in
this prestigious university is perhaps not as easy as you have expected. You may be tightly bound by daily classes,
abundant homework and frequent exams. Thus, be prepared for the hectic life here. In the second place, in spite of all
those burdens, various extracurricular activities such as sports meets, speech contests and social gatherings will still
provide ample opportunities to make friends. So, enjoy your life in this esteemed institute!<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;All in all, although there is a lot of pressure, the time you spend on our campus will be
worthwhile and enhance your whole life. Hope you like it here.<br>
<p align="right">Yours sincerely,</p>

Dear Sir or Madam,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I bought an electronic dictionary from your online store on January 1st, but after using it for
a short period of time, I found it has some problems.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To begin with, the battery needs recharging after a mere 2 hours of use. This means that I need
to carry my charger with me when I go out for a day. In addition, the buttons on the electronic dictionary **are** so
small that it is nearly impossible to type anything with them. Personally, I find **this to be completely unacceptable
**.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Therefore, I would like **either to change for** another model that works better or a full
refund. Your help is greatly appreciated.<br>
<p align="right">**Yours** sincerely</p>

Dear Professor Cook,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We are greatly honored to welcome you as a guest professor at our university. I would like to
recommend two scenic spots in our city: the Palace Museum and the Great Wall.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The primary reasons are as follows. To begin with, the Palace Museum, also known as the
Forbidden City, was the imperial palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. **It is also the largest piece of ancient
Chinese architecture currently existing.** Meanwhile, the Great Wall, symbolizing China's ancient civilization, **is one
of the world's most renowned projects**. **As the great creation of the ancient Chinese people and one of the wonders of
the world**, it was listed as one of the world cultural heritage sites in 1987.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I hope you will have the opportunity to visit one or both of these spots. We wish you enjoy your
stay in our city.<br>
<p align="right">Yours sincerely,</p>

Dear Professor Smith,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am looking forward to my travel to the United States and **visiting** you in Harvard
University.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Unfortunately**, I have recently been diagnosed with a serious ear infection which will
require **surgery** on the same day as my departure. I am sorry to say that I will therefore not be able to make the
travel plan. If possible, I would like to postpone the travel plan to another day later this year. I promise that such a
situation **does** not usually happen, and **apologize** for any **inconvenience** this may cause you.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Please excuse me for not being able to inform you of my situation sooner. Your prompt attention

Dear Paul,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I'm glad to hear from you. How have you been these days? Since you're going to **present** an *
*oral** report on an ancient Chinese **scientist**, Bi Sheng is an ideal candidate.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the middle of the 11 century during the Song **Dynasty**, Bi Sheng invented the movable type
printing technique. He mainly **used** clay type, which **saved** much time and money compared with block printing.
After that, the movable type printing technique was widely promoted. China's printing technique was **spread** to the *
*Arabic region** during the Yuan Dynasty and then to **Africa and Europe**. Printing provided **a** significant
condition for the European **science** to develop **rapidly** after the long night of the medieval period and **the
emergence of the Renaissance**.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I hope you find the above recommendations useful. Looking forward to your successful
presentation.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As you know, I will invite a great many **craftsmen** to our **campus**. They will show a *
*variety** of **innovative** Chinese craft-making, especially silk-making. Silk-making is a **handicraft inherited**
from ancient China, as well as a traditional art form. Silk is a symbol of **ancient Chinese culture**, and the long
history of China's silk industry is **a brilliant page** in the **encyclopedia** of Chinese culture.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This event is going to be held in the Students' Recreation Center from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm on
May 1, 2025. Could you please help me **to** write the letters of invitation **to** all the craftsmen? Looking forward
to your support.<br>

Dear John,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As you know, I am extremely keen on the ancient Chinese novel-*Romance of the Three Kingdoms*.
Now I am planning to direct a short play revised from it<br>

Dear Paul,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I'm extremely happy to learn you are coming to China! Here are my recommendations.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Since it's the first time you visit China. I highly recommend Beijing, the capital of China.
Beijing is a city in the northern part of China. As a center of politics, culture, international communication, and
scientific and technological innovation, Beijing attracts talent from all over the country, displaying China's
development to the world.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As for tourist attractions, I suggest you visit the Imperial Palace, the Great Wall and the
Summer Palace, all of which have been listed on the UN's World Heritage List. It is true that Beijing, once an ancient
imperial city, is now a genuine metropolis. Looking forward to meeting you in Beijing.<br>

亲爱的保罗:
得知你要来中国，我太高兴了!以下是我的一些建议。
鉴于这是你第一次到访中国,我强烈推荐中国的首都北京。北京位于中国北方。作为政治文化、国际交流以及科技创新的中心，它吸引着来自全国各地的人才，同时向世界展示着中国的发展。
至于旅游景点，我建议你参观故宫、长城和颐和园，这些景点都已被列入联合国《世界遗产名录》。可以说，北京这座曾经的古老皇城，如今已成为一座真正的大都市。期待在北京与你相见!

Peking-the first national comprehensive university in modern China. For over a century, she had contributed to the
development of China and the change of the destiny of its people. As China's leading higher education institution for
teaching and researching, Peking University enjoys an excellent academic reputation, attracting top scholars and

University as your best choices. Your resume and application letter play a vital role in application. Looking forward to

Dear friends,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am writing the email to recommend one of the most prestigious Chinese celebrities to you,
Confucius.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;First of all, being a great thinker, educator and founder of Confucianism, Confucius is an
ancient sage during the Spring and Autumn Period. In addition, his words and life story were recorded by his disciples
and their student in *The Analects*. As an enduring classic of ancient Chinese culture, *The Analects* has influenced
all thinkers, writers and politicians in the over-2000-year-long history of China after Confucius. Finally, much of
Confucian thought still remains the interest of not only the Chinese people but also people in other parts of the
world.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If you have any questions about Confucius, please feel free to contact me.<br>

Dear Mr. Shakespeare,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am writing to express my heartfelt gratitude. I am referring to that unfortunate accident the
other day, when I was knocked off my bike by a taxi.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If it had not been for your timely assistance in giving me first aid, I fear that the
consequences might have been very serious. Everyone agrees that it is your quick-witted response in that emergency that
had led to this satisfactory outcome.
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Although nowadays people in mounting numbers talk about the need to be unselfish, we see very
