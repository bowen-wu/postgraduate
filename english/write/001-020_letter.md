Dear Bob,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I have just arrived at my home from the airport. As I sit down at my desk, I just want to write
a letter to you to thank you for your warm reception in the cultural exchange program. You and your family left a deep
impression upon me. Indeed, the program is one of the most wonderful memories in my life.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I remember you mentioned wanting to travel in China. Well, if you come to China, You will be
warmly welcomed, and it will be my pleasure to be your guide here. If you would like, send me a list beforehand of the
places you would like to visit.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Please give my best regards to your family.<br>
<p align="right">Yours,</p>

Dear friends,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;On behalf of the Students' Union of Beijing Foreign Studies University, I would like to extend
our heartfelt welcome to all the overseas students who will study in our university.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is my great pleasure to offer you several practical suggestions. In the first place, life in
this prestigious university is perhaps not as easy as you have expected. You may be tightly bound by daily classes,
abundant homework and frequent exams. Thus, be prepared for the hectic life here. In the second place, in spite of all
those burdens, various extracurricular activities such as sports meets, speech contests and social gatherings will still
provide ample opportunities to make friends. So, enjoy your life in this esteemed institute!<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;All in all, although there is a lot of pressure, the time you spend on our campus will be
worthwhile and enhance your whole life. Hope you like it here.<br>
<p align="right">Yours sincerely,</p>

Dear Sir or Madam,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I bought an electronic dictionary from your online shore on January 1st, but after using it for
a short period of time, I found it has some problems.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To begin with, the battery needs recharging after a mere 2 hours of use. This means that I need
to carry my charger with me when I go out for a day. In addition, the buttons on the electronic dictionary are so small
that it is nearly impossible to type anything with them. Personally, I find this to be completely unacceptable.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Therefore, I would like either to change for another model that works better or a full refund.
Your help is greatly appreciated.<br>
<p align="right">Yours sincerely</p>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;On behalf of the "Talents" English Speech Contest committee, I'm writing to invite you to be our
new judge.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As the core of our "Foreign Culture Festival", this school-wide contest is to be held in the

comments as both a native-English speaker and a knowledgeable professor. Specifically, the event will start at around 7:
00 p.m. and last for 2 hours at most. At the end of it, we will have some hand-made presents for each judge and
competitor.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Once again, we sincerely hope you can be the judge for our competition.
<p align="right">Yours sincerely,</p>

Dear Professor Cook,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We are greatly honored to welcome you as a guest professor at our university. I would like to
recommend two scenic spots in our city: the Palace Museum and the Great Wall.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The primary reasons are as follows. To begin with, the Palace Museum, also known as the
Forbidden City, was the imperial(皇帝的) palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. It is also the largest piece of ancient
Chinese architecture currently existing. MeanWhile, the Great Wall, symbolizing China's ancient civilization, is one of
the world's most renowned projects. As the great creation of the ancient Chinese people and one of the wonders of the
world, it was listed as one of the world cultural heritage sites in 1987.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I hope you will have the opportunity to visit one or both of these spots. We wish you enjoy your
stay in our city.<br>
<p align="right">Yours sincerely,</p>

Dear Professor Smith,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am looking forward to my travel to the United States and visiting you in Harvard
University.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Unfortunately, I have recently been diagnosed with a serious ear infection which will require
surgery on the same day as my departure. I am sorry to say that I will therefore not be able to make the travel plan. If
possible, I would like to postpone the travel plan to another day later this year. I promise that such a situation does
not usually happen, and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Please excuse me for not being able to inform you of my situation sooner. Your prompt attention
to my suggestion would be highly appreciated.<br>

<p align="right">Yours sincerely,</p>

Dear Paul,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I'm glad to hear from you. How have you been these days? Since you're going to present an oral
report on an ancient Chinese scientist, Bi Sheng is an ideal candidate.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the middle of the 11 century during the Song Dynasty, Bi Sheng invented the movable type
printing technique. He mainly used clay type, which saved much time and money compared with block printing. After that,
the movable type printing technique was widely promoted. China's printing technique was spread to the Arabic region
during the Yuan Dynasty and then to Africa and Europe. Printing provided a significant condition for the European
science to develop rapidly after the long night of the medieval period and the emergence of the Renaissance.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I hope you find the above recommendations useful. Looking forward to your successful
presentation.<br>

<p align="right">Yours,</p>
<p align="right">Li Ming</p>

Dear Paul,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I'm glad to hear from you. Thank you for your enthusiastic response to the event!<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As you know, I will invite a great many craftsmen to our campus. They will show a variety of
innovative Chinese craft-making, especially silk-marking. Silk-marking is a handicraft inherited from ancient China, as
well as a traditional art form. Silk is a symbol of ancient Chinese culture, and the long history of China's silk
industry is a brilliant page in the encyclopedia of Chinese culture.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This event is going to be held in the Students' Recreation Center from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm on
May 1, 2025. Could you please help me to write the letters of invitation to all the craftsmen? Looking forward to your
support.<br>

<p align="right">Yours faithfully,</p>

Dear John,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As you know, I am extremely keen on the ancient Chinese novel-*Romance of the Three Kingdoms*.
Now I am planning to direct a short play revised from it<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, as one of the Four Great Classical Novels in China, mainly
depicts the political and military struggles during the Three Kingdoms Period and reveals the turbulent society. It
successfully portrays images of classic characters, such as Zhuge Liang, Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Cao Cao, and so on.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Since you excel in acting, I cordially invite you to participate in the play and act as the
leading hero, Zhuge Liang. I'm sure you will be quite interested in it. Looking forward to your reply.<br>

<p align="right">Yours,</p>

Dear Paul,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I'm extremely happy to learn you are coming to China! Here are my recommendations.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Since it's the first time you visit China. I highly recommend Beijing, the capital of China. Beijing is a city in the northern part of China. As a center of politics, culture, international communication, and scientific and technological innovation, Beijing attracts talent from all over the country, displaying China's development to the world.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As for tourist attractions, I suggest you visit the Imperial Palace, the Great Wall and the Summer Palace, all of which have been listed on the UN's World Heritage List. It is true that Beijing, once an ancient imperial city, is now a genuine metropolis. Looking forward to meeting you in Beijing.<br>

<p align="right">Yours,</p>
<p align="right">Li Ming</p>

Dear Paul,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Thank you for your congratulations! In September, I'm going to pursue my master's degree in Peking University, one of the top two universities in China.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Established in 1898, Peking University was originally founded as the Imperial University of Peking-the first national comprehensive university in modern China. For over a century, she had contributed to the development of China and the change of the destiny of its people. As China's leading higher education institution for teaching and researching, Peking University enjoys an excellent academic reputation, attracting top scholars and students from China and all over the world.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As for your application to a Chinese university, I suggest Peking University and Tsinghua University as your best choices. Your resume and application letter play a vital role in application. Looking forward to your reply.<br>

<p align="right">Yours,</p>

Dear friends,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am writing the email to recommend one of the most prestigious Chinese celebrities to you, Confucius.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;First of all, being a great thinker, educator and founder of Confucianism, Confucius is an ancient sage during the Spring and Autumn Period. In addition, his words and life story were recorded by his disciples and their student in *The Analects*. As an enduring classic of ancient Chinese culture, *The Analects* has influenced all thinkers, writers and politicians in the over-2000-year-long history of China after Confucius. Finally, much of Confucian thought still remains the interest of not only the Chinese people but also people in other parts of the world.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If you have any questions about Confucius, please feel free to contact me.<br>

<p align="right">Yours sincerely,</p>

Dear Mr. Snakespeare,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am writing to express my heartfelt gratitude. I am referring to that unfortunate accident the other day, when I was knocked off my bike by a taxi.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If it had not been for your timely assistance in giving me first aid, I fear that the consequences might have been very serious. Everyone agrees that it is your quick-witted response in that emergency that had led to this satisfactory outcome.
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Although nowadays people in mounting numbers talk about the need to be unselfish, we see very few people practise what they preach. If there were more people like you, this world would be a much nicer place.<br>
