&emsp;&emsp;From the information given in the above column chart, we can see a striking contrast between developing and
developed countries in mobile-phone subscriptions from 2000 to 2008. During this period, there has been a dramatic
increase from 0.4 to 4 billion mobile-phone subscriptions in developing countries, while those of developed countries
remained steady at just under 1 billion.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;At least two fundamental factors could have contributed to this phenomenon. On the one hand, with the rapid
increase in economic development happening in developing countries, the telecommunication industry in those countries
has expanded greatly to meet the demand of globalization. As a result, the user base of mobile phones which can narrow
the distance between people and link the whole world together, grew at an incredible speed. On the other hand, the
extremely advanced economy of developed countries means less potential in many aspects and their demand for further
enlargement tends to saturate.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Although the fact remains that phones are already extremely prevalent in both developing and developed
countries, the growing gap will continue to widen in the future. Therefore, mobile phone manufacturers should pay more
attention to the market in developing countries.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;The table clearly reflects the statistics of staff's job satisfaction in a certain company. According to the
data given above, we can conclude that the percentage of people satisfied with their jobs is the highest among those
over 50 years old, at about 40%. In contrast, the percentage of the staff not satisfied with their jobs is about 64%
among those in their forties, the highest among all the three age groups.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The major determinant of satisfaction lies in people's attitudes. On the one hand, staff members in their
forties usually have to undertake a lot of responsibilities from both their families and their careers. So, they have
the least satisfaction in their jobs. On the other hand, people over 50 generally have shifted their life goals from
achieving the ultimate success to a relatively easy and comfortable life, and therefore are inclined to be much more
satisfied with their jobs.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;In view of the above reasoning, I am convinced that it is difficult for everyone to be content with their
jobs. And it is advisable that people should adjust their expectations for work, and that companies should pay more
attention to the welfare of their staff.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;The column chart above clearly illustrates the operation mileage of high-speed railway in China between 2016
and 2023. According to the diagram, between 2016 and 2017, the operating railway lines increased slightly from 22000
kilometers to 25000 kilometers, a rise of merely 3000 kilometers. By contrast, it jumped markedly from 25000 kilometers
to 45000 kilometers between 2017 and 2023, an increase of 20000 kilometers within six years.
&emsp;&emsp;The high-speed rail has significantly changed the lives of Chinese people. To begin with, it has driven the
development of short-term tourism and economic prosperity. In addition, it allows passengers to shuttle between various 
major cities in China in one day. Last but not least, it enables people to pursue job opportunities across different
provinces.
&emsp;&emsp;Given all the arguments above, we may come to the conclusion that with the speedy development of economy,
the mileage of high-speed railway in China will keep growing in the forthcoming decade.

&emsp;&emsp;上面的柱状图清晰地展示了
2016年至2023年间中国高铁的运营里程情况。根据该图表，从2016年至2017年，运营里程从2.2万公里小幅增长至2.5万公里，只增长了3千公里。相比之下，从2017年到2023年，运营里程从2.5万公里大幅增加至4.5万公里，在六年的时间内增长了2万公里。
&emsp;&emsp;高铁极大地改变了中国人的生活。首先，它带动了短期旅游的发展,从而促进了经济繁荣。其次，它可以让旅客在一天内在中国多个大城市间穿梭。最后但同样重要的是，它使人们能够在不同省份之间寻找工作机会。
&emsp;&emsp;鉴于上述所有论点，我们可以得出结论:随着经济的迅猛发展，中国高铁里程在未来十年将继续增长。

&emsp;&emsp;What is shown in the chart above indicates that by the end of 2023, the ownership of New Energy Vehicles(NEVs) in China reached 20.41 million. In the meantime, the newly registered NEVs throughout the year in China got to 7.43 million.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Why are NEVs booming nowadays? Several factors bring about this phenomenon. To begin with, the promotion of NEVs is an effective practice to ease impending energy shortages. It is universally acknowledged that we are likely to face a global energy shortage over the next few decades. More importantly, one significant benefit of developing NEVs is that can help to curb the problem of air pollution and thus promote a cleaner and greener environment. Last but not least, the NEV industry is regarded as a backbone, or key industry, acting as an engine of and supporting many subsidiary industries, such as steel, machinery, glass, rubber, tires, paints, and so on<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Generally speaking, NEVs are an irresistible historical trend and a fashion, which we should embrace without hesitation.

&emsp;&emsp;上面的图表显示，到 2023年底，我国新能源汽车保有量达到了2041万辆。与此同时全年新登记注册的新能源汽车达 743 万辆。<br>
&emsp;&emsp;为什么如今新能源汽车发展如此迅猛?一些因素造成了这一现象。首先，推广新能源汽车是缓解迫在眉睫的能源短缺问题的一个有效做法。众所周知，未来几十年，我们很可能会面临世界能源短缺问题。更重要的是，发展新能源汽车的一个重大好处就是它们有助于遏制空气污染问题，从而促进形成更加清洁、环保的环境。最后但同样重要的是，新能源汽车产业被视为一大支柱产业或关键产业，带动并支持着钢铁、机械、玻璃、橡胶、轮胎、涂料等许多辅助产业的发展。<br>
&emsp;&emsp;总之，新能源汽车是不可阻挡的历史潮流，是一种时尚，我们应该毫不犹豫地接受它。<br>

### Example

&emsp;&emsp;The pie chart above clearly reveals the results of a survey on the average times of consumers' ordering takeaway per month in China in 2021. According to the data, the percentage of ordering takeaway from on to five times is the largest among the five groups, accounting for 35.2%; the percentage of ordering takeaway from six to ten times is 27%. In contrast, the percentage of never ordering takeaway merely takes up 18.5%.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Primary factors that result in the phenomenon may be summarized as follows. To begin with, with the quickening pace of urban life and ever-increasing work pressure in recent years, a good many people prefer ordering takeaway to going to a restaurant. In addition, in a bid to enjoy a comfortable life, instead of cooking by themselves, consumers in mounting numbers are willing to order takeaway in companies or at home. Lastly, the prosperous takeaway industry can be ascribed to the speedy development of online shopping and express delivery business.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Briefly speaking, the booming takeaway industry undoubtedly contributes to the prosperity of the economy.<br>

以上饼状图清楚地显示了2021年中国消费者月均点外卖次数的调研结果。根据数据，在这五组中，点外卖1-5次的人数在这五组中占比最大，占35.2%;点外卖6-10次的人数占比为 27%。相比之下，从来不点外卖的人仅占18.5%。<br>
造成上述现象的主要原因如下。首先，随着近年来都市生活节奏的加快以及工作压力的不断增加，比起去餐馆，很多人更喜欢点外卖。其次，为了享受舒适的生活，越来越多的消费者喜欢在公司或家里点外卖，而不是自己做饭。最后，繁荣的外卖行业应该归功于网上购物和快递产业的迅猛发展。<br>
简言之，快速发展的外卖行业无疑有助于经济的繁荣。<br>

&emsp;&emsp;The diagram above clearly reflects that China has made tremendous achievements in poverty alleviation from 2012 to 2020. During this period, China's impoverished rural population decreased considerably from nearly 100 million to nearly zero, a decline of 100 million. At the same time, the poverty headcount ratio also fell from approximately 10% to almost 0%.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Several primary factors for the above-mentioned changes can be summarized as follows. To begin with, the relevant authorities in China have adopted a combination of conventional and innovative approaches to improve rural education and healthcare. What is more, China has put great emphasis on the establishment of infrastructure in poor rural areas, which has effectively bridged the gap between the rich and the poor. Last but not least, these achievements can be attributed to China's speedy economic development during the past several decades.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;In short, China's poverty alleviation campaign is vital both nationally and internationally. To start with, anti-poverty achievements have allowed more people to enjoy the advantages of China's economic boom. What is more, the Chinese government has fulfilled its promise of lifting all its citizens out of poverty.<br>
