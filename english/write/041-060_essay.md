### Example

&emsp;&emsp;From the information given in the above column chart, we can see a striking contrast between developing and
developed countries in mobile-phone subscriptions from 2000 to 2008. During this period, there has been a dramatic
increase from 0.4 to 4 billion mobile-phone subscriptions in developing countries, while those of developed countries
remained steady at just under 1 billion.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;At least two fundamental factors could have contributed to this phenomenon. On the one hand, with the rapid
increase in economic development happening in developing countries, the telecommunication industry in those countries
has expanded greatly to meet the demand of globalization. As a result, the user base of mobile phones which can narrow
the distance between people and link the whole world together, grew at an incredible speed. On the other hand, the
extremely advanced economy of developed countries means less potential in many aspects and their demand for further
enlargement tends to saturate.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Although the fact remains that phones are already extremely prevalent in both developing and developed
countries, the growing gap will continue to widen in the future. Therefore, mobile phone manufacturers should pay more
attention to the market in developing countries.<br>

### 译文

根据上面的柱状图提供的信息，我们可以看出，从2000年到2008年，发展中国家和发达国家在手机入网方面存在着惊人的对比。在此期间，发展中国家手机入网数从4亿急速增长到
40 亿，而发达国家的相关数据在10亿之下保持平稳。<br>
至少有两点主要原因造成了这种现象。一方面，随着发展中国家的经济快速增长这些国家的电信产业大幅扩张以满足全球化的需求。因此，使用手机来缩短人与人之间的距离并与全世界联系的人数以惊人的速度增长。另一方面，发达国家高度发达的经济意味着它们在诸多领域发展潜力较小，他们对进一步开发的需求趋于饱和。<br>
尽管手机在发展中国家和发达国家已经非常普遍，但这一差距在未来还会继续扩大。因此，手机制造商应该更加关注发展中国家的市场。

&emsp;&emsp;The table clearly reflects the statistics of staff's job satisfaction in a certain company. According to the
data given above, we can conclude that the percentage of people satisfied with their jobs is the highest among those
over 50 years old, at about 40%. In contrast, the percentage of the staff not satisfied with their jobs is about 64%
among those in their forties, the highest among all the three age groups.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The major determinant of satisfaction lies in people's attitudes. On the one hand, staff members in their
forties usually have to undertake a lot of responsibilities from both their families and their careers. So, they have
the least satisfaction in their jobs. On the other hand, people over 50 generally have shifted their life goals from
achieving the ultimate success to a relatively easy and comfortable life, and therefore are inclined to be much more
satisfied with their jobs.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;In view of the above reasoning, I am convinced that it is difficult for everyone to be content with their
jobs. And it is advisable that people should adjust their expectations for work, and that companies should pay more
attention to the welfare of their staff.<br>

### Example

&emsp;&emsp;The column chart above clearly illustrates the operation mileage of high-speed railway in China between 2016
and 2023. According to the diagram, between 2016 and 2017, the operating railway lines increased slightly from 22000
kilometers to 25000 kilometers, a rise of merely 3000 kilometers. By contrast, it jumped markedly from 25000 kilometers
to 45000 kilometers between 2017 and 2023, an increase of 20000 kilometers within six years.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The high-speed rail has significantly changed the lives of Chinese people. To begin with, it has driven the
development of short-term tourism and economic prosperity. In addition, it allows passengers to shuttle between various
major cities in China in one day. Last but not least, it enables people to pursue job opportunities across different
provinces.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Given all the arguments above, we may come to the conclusion that with the speedy development of economy,
the mileage of high-speed railway in China will keep growing in the forthcoming decade.

### 译文

&emsp;&emsp;上面的柱状图清晰地展示了2016年至2023年间中国高铁的运营里程情况。根据该图表，从2016年至2017年，运营里程从2.2万公里小幅增长至2.5万公里，只增长了3千公里。相比之下，从2017年到2023年，运营里程从2.5万公里大幅增加至4.5万公里，在六年的时间内增长了2万公里。<br>
&emsp;&emsp;高铁极大地改变了中国人的生活。首先，它带动了短期旅游的发展,从而促进了经济繁荣。其次，它可以让旅客在一天内在中国多个大城市间穿梭。最后但同样重要的是，它使人们能够在不同省份之间寻找工作机会。<br>
&emsp;&emsp;鉴于上述所有论点，我们可以得出结论:随着经济的迅猛发展，中国高铁里程在未来十年将继续增长。

&emsp;&emsp;What is shown in the chart above indicates that by the end of 2023, the ownership of New Energy Vehicles(
NEVs) in China reached 20.41 million. In the meantime, the newly registered NEVs throughout the year in China got to
7.43 million.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Why are NEVs booming nowadays? Several factors bring about this phenomenon. To begin with, the promotion of
NEVs is an effective practice to ease impending energy shortages. It is universally acknowledged that we are likely to
face a global energy shortage over the next few decades. More importantly, one significant benefit of developing NEVs is
that can help to curb the problem of air pollution and thus promote a cleaner and greener environment. Last but not
least, the NEV industry is regarded as a backbone, or key industry, acting as an engine of and supporting many
subsidiary industries, such as steel, machinery, glass, rubber, tires, paints, and so on<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Generally speaking, NEVs are an irresistible historical trend and a fashion, which we should embrace without
hesitation.

万辆。<br>
&emsp;&emsp;为什么如今新能源汽车发展如此迅猛?一些因素造成了这一现象。首先，推广新能源汽车是缓解迫在眉睫的能源短缺问题的一个有效做法。众所周知，未来几十年，我们很可能会面临世界能源短缺问题。更重要的是，发展新能源汽车的一个重大好处就是它们有助于遏制空气污染问题，从而促进形成更加清洁、环保的环境。最后但同样重要的是，新能源汽车产业被视为一大支柱产业或关键产业，带动并支持着钢铁、机械、玻璃、橡胶、轮胎、涂料等许多辅助产业的发展。<br>
&emsp;&emsp;总之，新能源汽车是不可阻挡的历史潮流，是一种时尚，我们应该毫不犹豫地接受它。<br>

### Example

&emsp;&emsp;The pie chart above clearly reveals the results of a survey on the average times of consumers' ordering
takeaway per month in China in 2021. According to the data, the percentage of ordering takeaway from one to five times
is the largest among the five groups, accounting for 35.2%; the percentage of ordering takeaway from six to ten times is
27%. In contrast, the percentage of never ordering takeaway merely takes up 18.5%.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Primary factors that result in the phenomenon may be summarized as follows. To begin with, with the
quickening pace of urban life and ever-increasing work pressure in recent years, a good many people prefer ordering
takeaway to going to a restaurant. In addition, in a bid to enjoy a comfortable life, instead of cooking by themselves,
consumers in mounting numbers are willing to order takeaway in companies or at home. Lastly, the prosperous takeaway
industry can be ascribed to the speedy development of online shopping and express delivery business.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Briefly speaking, the booming takeaway industry undoubtedly contributes to the prosperity of the
economy.<br>

以上饼状图清楚地显示了2021年中国消费者月均点外卖次数的调研结果。根据数据，在这五组中，点外卖1-5次的人数在这五组中占比最大，占35.2%;点外卖6-10次的人数占比为
27%。相比之下，从来不点外卖的人仅占18.5%。<br>
造成上述现象的主要原因如下。首先，随着近年来都市生活节奏的加快以及工作压力的不断增加，比起去餐馆，很多人更喜欢点外卖。其次，为了享受舒适的生活，越来越多的消费者喜欢在公司或家里点外卖，而不是自己做饭。最后，繁荣的外卖行业应该归功于网上购物和快递产业的迅猛发展。<br>
简言之，快速发展的外卖行业无疑有助于经济的繁荣。<br>

&emsp;&emsp;The diagram above clearly reflects that China has made tremendous achievements in poverty alleviation from
2012 to 2020. During this period, China's impoverished rural population decreased considerably from nearly 100 million
to nearly zero, a decline of 100 million. At the same time, the poverty headcount ratio also fell from approximately 10%
to almost 0%.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Several primary factors for the above-mentioned changes can be summarized as follows. To begin with, the
relevant authorities in China have adopted a combination of conventional and innovative approaches to improve rural
education and healthcare. What is more, China has put great emphasis on the establishment of infrastructure in poor
rural areas, which has effectively bridged the gap between the rich and the poor. Last but not least, these achievements
can be attributed to China's speedy economic development during the past several decades.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;In short, China's poverty alleviation campaign is vital both nationally and internationally. To start with,
anti-poverty achievements have allowed more people to enjoy the advantages of China's economic boom. What is more, the
Chinese government has fulfilled its promise of lifting all its citizens out of poverty.<br>

上面的图表清楚地揭示了2012年到2020年间中国在扶贫方面取得的巨大成就。在此期间中国的农村贫困人口数量从大约1亿大幅减少到几乎为零，减少了近1亿。与此同时，农村的贫困人口比例从大约
10%下降到几乎为零。<br>
促成上述变化的主要因素可以概括如下。首先，中国相关部门结合传统方法和创新方法，帮助改善了农村地区的教育和医疗水平。其次，中国非常重视农村贫困地区的基础设施建设，有效缩小了贫富差距。最后但同样重要的是,这一成就可以归功于过去几十年中国经济的快速发展。<br>
总之，中国的扶贫战役对本国和世界都极为重要。首先，反贫困的成就让更多的人享受到中国经济繁荣的好处。更重要的是，中国政府已经实现了全民脱贫的承诺。<br>

### Example

&emsp;&emsp;The column chart demonstrates the Gross Merchandise Volume(GMV) of live broadcasting electronic commerce in
China from 2017 to 2024. Between 2017 and 2019, the GMV increased mildly from RMB 16.8 billion to 416.8 billion, a rise
of 400 billion yuan. By contrast, it jumped considerably from RMB 416.8 billion to 5316.6 billion from 2019 to 2024.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The booming of live broadcasting exerts a profound influence on our society. On the one hand, China is
witnessing the Internet swarming with wanghong, the grass-root Internet celebrities who win nationwide popularity by
pulling stunts. As a result, a large number of consumers are willing to shop online via the live broadcasting of these
anchors, which promotes the development of economy. On the other hand, some behaviors of a good many live broadcasting
anchors convey wrong values to customers and teenagers. Some anchors attract their followers by dishonest words and
false promises. This will undeniably shape the customers' values in a negative way.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;In sum, I cling to the idea that live broadcasting is a double-edged sword, which exerts both positive and
negative effects on consumers and society.

&emsp;&emsp;这个柱状图显示了2017年至2024年中国直播电商的商品交易总额规模。从2017年到2019年，商品交易总额从168亿元温和增长到4168亿元，增长了4000亿元。相比之下，从2019
年到 2024 年，商品交易总额从 4168 亿元大幅增长到 53166 亿元。<br>
&emsp;&emsp;直播的繁荣对我们的社会产生了深远的影响。一方面，中国的社交网络涌现出越来越多的网红，这些来自草根阶层的网络名人通过大搞噱头成功地在全国受到追捧。因此，很多消费者愿意通过这些主播的直播进行网上购物，这促进了经济的发展。另一方面，很多直播主播的一些行为会给消费者和青少年传达错误的价值观。一些主播靠谎言和虚假的承诺吸引自己的粉丝。不可否认的是，这会对消费者的价值观造成负面的影响。<br>
&emsp;&emsp;总之，我认为直播是一把双刃剑,既会对消费者和社会造成积极影响,也会造成负面影响。

&emsp;&emsp;It is apparent from the table above that the total revenue of the tourist industry has reached 2.5 trillion
RMB in 2015, at a growth rate of 10% per year. From the statistics given in the table, we can see that the value added
in tourism has accounted for 4.5% of national GDP and 12% of the value added in the service sector.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Many countries are striving to develop their national tourism because it really has a lot of advantages.
First and foremost, travel provides many opportunities to promote exchanges among people from diverse cultural
backgrounds. For instance, since the reform and opening-up, China, a country which has rich tourism resources, receives
millions of foreign tourists every year. Moreover, travel increases one's knowledge, widens one's horizons ande enhances 
mutual understanding. Finally, tourism boosts local economy and promotes commercial exchanges.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;由于旅游业确实有很多优点，很多国家都在努力发展本国旅游业。首先且最重要的是旅游为促进不同文化背景之间人们的相互交流提供很多机会。例如，改革开放以来，作为-个拥有丰富旅游资源的国家，中国每年都接待数以百万计的外国游客。此外，旅游可以增长人们的知识，开阔人们的视野，并增进人们之间的相互理解。最后，旅游业带动了地方经济的发展并促进了商业交流。<br>

&emsp;&emsp;Several factors could contribute to this tendency. In the first place, with the quickening pace and ever-increasing pressure of urban life, people in growing numbers are suffering either physical or mental problems. Thus, gymnasiums in mounting numbers have been built by concerned departments. In the second place, the desire for good health is universal.

&emsp;&emsp;It is subtly illustrated in the portrayal on the left that a foreign lady is pleasantly appreciating a traditional Chinese vase in a museum. Obviously, she has been attracted by its elegant charm. The column chart on the right clearly reveals that between 2010 and 2024, the number of Chinese Peking Opera troupes performing abroad rose dramatically from 100 to 550, an increase of 450.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;In my opinion, traditional Chinese culture is not only certain to survive, but is, in fact, destined to thrive and prosper. One factor that has already begun to contribute to the preservation of traditional Chinese culture is its commercialization. Another reason that the future of China's traditional culture can be considered "safe" is the active efforts to protect it on the part of the Chinese government. Finally, the traditional culture of China is supported by widespread and growing international interest in China and its traditions.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;For China, as any other rapidly developing country, there is a danger that age-old customs and traditions may become lost in the shadow of modernization. Fortunately, as a result of successful commercialization efforts, unwavering government support and growing interest overseas, the future of China's traditional culture seem brighter and more secure than ever before.

&emsp;&emsp;在我看来，中国传统文化不但肯定能够存续，而且事实上必将会繁荣兴盛。首先，已经开始对保护中国传统文化做出贡献的一个因素是其自身的商业化。其次，中国传统文化的未来可被视为“安全”的另一个原因是中国政府在保护文化方面做出了积极努力。最后，随着国际上对中国及其传统广泛且越来越浓厚的兴趣，中国传统文化得到了国际上的支持。<br>
&emsp;&emsp;中国跟世界上其他快速发展的国家一样，古老的习俗和传统在现代化的阴影下面临着消失的危险。但幸运的是，由于成功的商业努力、政府坚定不移的支持和不断增长的来自海外的兴趣，中国传统文化的未来似乎比过去任何时候都更光明、更安全。
