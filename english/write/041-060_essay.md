### Example

&emsp;&emsp;From the information given in the above column chart, we can see a striking contrast between developing and
developed countries in mobile-phone subscriptions from 2000 to 2008. During this period, there has been a dramatic
increase from 0.4 to 4 billion mobile-phone subscriptions in developing countries, while those of developed countries
remained steady at just under 1 billion.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;At least two fundamental factors could have contributed to this phenomenon. On the one hand, with the rapid
increase in economic development happening in developing countries, the telecommunication industry in those countries
has expanded greatly to meet the demand of globalization. As a result, the user base of mobile phones which can narrow
the distance between people and link the whole world together, grew at an incredible speed. On the other hand, the
extremely advanced economy of developed countries means less potential in many aspects and their demand for further
enlargement tends to saturate.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Although the fact remains that phones are already extremely prevalent in both developing and developed
countries, the growing gap will continue to widen in the future. Therefore, mobile phone manufacturers should pay more
attention to the market in developing countries.<br>

### 译文

根据上面的柱状图提供的信息，我们可以看出，从2000年到2008年，发展中国家和发达国家在手机入网方面存在着惊人的对比。在此期间，发展中国家手机入网数从4亿急速增长到
40 亿，而发达国家的相关数据在10亿之下保持平稳。<br>
至少有两点主要原因造成了这种现象。一方面，随着发展中国家的经济快速增长这些国家的电信产业大幅扩张以满足全球化的需求。因此，使用手机来缩短人与人之间的距离并与全世界联系的人数以惊人的速度增长。另一方面，发达国家高度发达的经济意味着它们在诸多领域发展潜力较小，他们对进一步开发的需求趋于饱和。<br>
尽管手机在发展中国家和发达国家已经非常普遍，但这一差距在未来还会继续扩大。因此，手机制造商应该更加关注发展中国家的市场。

&emsp;&emsp;The table clearly reflects the statistics of staff's job satisfaction in a certain company. According to the
data given above, we can conclude that the percentage of people satisfied with their jobs is the highest among those
over 50 years old, at about 40%. In contrast, the percentage of the staff not satisfied with their jobs is about 64%
among those in their forties, the highest among all the three age groups.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The major determinant of satisfaction lies in people's attitudes. On the one hand, staff members in their
forties usually have to undertake a lot of responsibilities from both their families and their careers. So, they have
the least satisfaction in their jobs. On the other hand, people over 50 generally have shifted their life goals from
achieving the ultimate success to a relatively easy and comfortable life, and therefore are inclined to be much more
satisfied with their jobs.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;In view of the above reasoning, I am convinced that it is difficult for everyone to be content with their
jobs. And it is advisable that people should adjust their expectations for work, and that companies should pay more
attention to the welfare of their staff.<br>

### Example

&emsp;&emsp;The pie chart clearly illustrates the purposes of touring for students in a certain university. As is reflected by the diagram, 37 percent of college students travel in order to appreciate the scenery. Next comes the aim of relieving pressure, accounting for 33 percent. By contrast, the percentages of students travelling aiming at other goals, making friends and clutivating independence account for 15%, 9% and 6% respectively.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Several primary factors could contribute to this phenomenon. In the first place, travel can offer us a wide range of experiences. In travelling, we may experience the bitterness and joy of people on different lands and in different times. In the sencond place, college students, who have to juggle academic work, romantic relationships and a busy social calendar, are particularly susceptible to pressure. By touring, they can successfully manage and reduce stress.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Taking all these factors into consideration, we may predict that with the quickening pace and ever-increasing pressure of campus life, the number of university students touring will keep growing in the forthcoming decade.

### 译文

&emsp;&emsp;这幅饼状图清楚地揭示了某高校大学生的旅游目的。如图表所示，37%的大学生为了欣赏风景而旅游。接下来是为了缓解压力，占了33%。相比之下，为了其他目的、广交朋友、培养独立能力而旅游的大学生百分比分别占15%、9%和6%。<br>
&emsp;&emsp;一些主要原因可以解释这种现象。首先，旅游能够充实我们的经历。在旅行中，我们可以体验不同时代、不同国土上人们的酸甜苦辣。其次，大学生不得不应对学习、恋爱和繁忙的社交日程，很容易感受到压力。通过旅游，他们可以成功地应对并缓解压力。<br>
&emsp;&emsp;考虑到所有这些因素，我们可以预计，随着校园生活节奏的加快和日益增加的压力旅游的大学生数量在未来十年将持续增加。

### Example

&emsp;&emsp;The pie chart above clearly reveals the factors of consumers' concern on choosing restaurants in a certain city in 2017. Among all the five categories, the percentages of feature, service and environment are the highest, accounting for 36.3%, 26.8% and 23.8% respectively. On the contrary, the statistics of price and other factors take up merely 8.4% and 4.7% respectively, the lowest among the five groups.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Several primary causes that contribute to the above-mentioned phenomenon could be summarized as follows. In the first place, with the prosperity of economy in China and the increase of people's income in recent decades, a large number of people are paying more attention to the feature of a restaurant instead of price. In the second place, in a bid to develop interpersonal relationship and enjoy comfortable life, consumers in mounting numbers prefer service and environment to other factors.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;With due consideration of all these contributors, we may predict that with the speedy development of our society, customers in expanding numbers will attach utmost significance to the feature, service as well as environment of a restaurant.

### 译文

&emsp;&emsp;造成上述现象的几个主要原因可以概括如下。首先，随着中国经济的繁荣和近几十年来人们收人的增加,很多人越来越关注餐厅的特色,而不是价格。其次,为了拓展人际关系享受舒适的生活，越来越多的消费者更注重服务与环境，而非其他因素。<br>
&emsp;&emsp;充分考虑到所有这些因素，我们可以预计，随着社会的迅速发展，越来越多的消费者将非常重视餐厅的特色、服务及环境。

&emsp;&emsp;Several factors that account for the above-mentioned phenomena could be summarized as follows. To start with, the main reason for sports and exercise is to encourage a healthy lifestyle. Exercising and playing sports can have huge benefits for a person's strength, agility, and figure. Furthermore, exercising with friends and families could instill the values of teamwork and sportsmanship. Exercising in general, whether individual or team-based, can teach people how to be sportsmanlike in competitive circumstances.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;The high-speed rail has significantly changed the lives of Chinese people. To begin with, it has driven the
development of short-term tourism and economic prosperity. In addition, it allows passengers to shuttle between various
major cities in China in one day. Last but not least, it enables people to pursue job opportunities across different

&emsp;&emsp;The booming of live broadcasting exerts a profound influence on our society. On the one hand, China is
witnessing the Internet swarming with wanghong, the grass-root Internet celebrities who win nationwide popularity by
pulling stunts. As a result, a large number of consumers are willing to shop online via the live broadcasting of these
anchors, which promotes the development of economy. On the other hand, some behaviors of a good many live broadcasting
anchors convey wrong values to customers and teenagers. Some anchors attract their followers by dishonest words and
false promises. This will undeniably shape the customers' values in a negative way.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;直播的繁荣对我们的社会产生了深远的影响。一方面，中国的社交网络涌现出越来越多的网红，这些来自草根阶层的网络名人通过大搞噱头成功地在全国受到追捧。因此，很多消费者愿意通过这些主播的直播进行网上购物，这促进了经济的发展。另一方面，很多直播主播的一些行为会给消费者和青少年传达错误的价值观。一些主播靠谎言和虚假的承诺吸引自己的粉丝。不可否认的是，这会对消费者的价值观造成负面的影响。<br>

The column chart on the right clearly reveals that between 2010 and 2024, the number of Chinese Peking Opera troupes performing abroad rose dramatically from 100 to 550, an increase of 450.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;In my opinion, traditional Chinese culture is not only certain to survive, but is, in fact, destined to thrive and prosper. One factor that has already begun to contribute to the preservation of traditional Chinese culture is its commercialization. Another reason that the future of China's traditional culture can be considered "safe" is the active efforts to protect it on the part of the Chinese government. Finally, the traditional culture of China is supported by widespread and growing international interest in China and its traditions.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;For China, as any other rapidly developing country, there is a danger that age-old customs and traditions may become lost in the shadow of modernization. Fortunately, as a result of successful commercialization efforts, unwavering government support and growing interest overseas, the future of China's traditional culture seem brighter and more secure than ever before.

&emsp;&emsp;在我看来，中国传统文化不但肯定能够存续，而且事实上必将会繁荣兴盛。首先，已经开始对保护中国传统文化做出贡献的一个因素是其自身的商业化。其次，中国传统文化的未来可被视为“安全”的另一个原因是中国政府在保护文化方面做出了积极努力。最后，随着国际上对中国及其传统广泛且越来越浓厚的兴趣，中国传统文化得到了国际上的支持。<br>
&emsp;&emsp;中国跟世界上其他快速发展的国家一样，古老的习俗和传统在现代化的阴影下面临着消失的危险。但幸运的是，由于成功的商业努力、政府坚定不移的支持和不断增长的来自海外的兴趣，中国传统文化的未来似乎比过去任何时候都更光明、更安全。

&emsp;&emsp;Changing technology stimulates the brain and increases intelligence, But that may onlybe true if technology challenges us. In a world run by intelligent machines, our lives could geta lot simpler, Would that make us less intelligent? Artificial intelligence is taking over manyhuman jobs. For instance, planes are being flown much of the time by automatic pilots. Andthe complex problem of controlling air traffic around large modern airports is also achievedby artificial intelligence that operates well beyond the capability of mere human air trafficcontrollers, Artificial intelligence is embedded in many features of modern life for a simplereason that intelligent machines can already outperform humans, including some aptitudeswhere there was once thought to be a human advantage, such as playing chess, and writingpoetry, or even novels<br>
&emsp;&emsp;As machines get smarter, they will do more of our thinking for us and make life easier.In the future, the electronic assistant will develop to the point that it serves similar functions as a real living butler, fulfilling requests such as: "Organize a dinner party for six on Thursday, and invite the usual guest." At that point, our long strggle with challenging technologies is at an end. We can take it easy kowning that the hard work of planning and organizing is being done by a better brain-the electronic assistant. Starved with mental effort, our brains well regress.

### Example

&emsp;&emsp;Currently, great achievements have been made in the field of artificial intelligence, which is taking over a good number of human jobs. In the excerpt, the author assumes that since artificial intelligence can plan and organize for us, our brains will regress. I disagree with the author's opinion.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;I cling to the idea that even if intelligent machines are getting increasingly smarter, our world will never be like a scene from science fiction in which human brains are infirior. To being with, no matter how superior its abilities are in certain areas, artificial intelligence needs us just as much as we need it. In other words, computer-based artificial intelligence has to rely on humans for maintenance to ensure its existence. What is more, face-to-face interactions between humans can never be replaced by machines. Intelligent machines are unlikely to develop human-like aocial competence, which requires empathy, sensitivity to tone, etc.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;To sum up, concern about whether artificial intelligence will make our brains regress is caused by an overestimation of the impact of technology on humans.

&emsp;&emsp;目前，人工智能领域已取得了巨大成就，人工智能正在接管很多人类所从事的工作。在这篇选段中，作者认为我们的大脑会退化，因为人工智能会为我们计划和组织工作。我不赞同作者的观点。<br>
&emsp;&emsp;我坚持认为，尽管智能机器正在变得越来越智能化，但我们的世界永远不会像科幻小说的场景中那样，人脑比不上智能机器。首先，不管智能机器的能力在某些领域有多高级，人工智能对我们的需要跟我们对它的需要一样多。换言之，以计算机为基础的人工智能不得不依赖人类的维护才能确保自身的存在。其次，机器永远不可能替代人与人之间面对面的互动。智能机器不太可能发展出像人类一样的社交能力，这需要同理心、对语气的敏感度等。<br>
&emsp;&emsp;综上所述，对于人工智能是否会造成我们大脑退化的担忧，是因为高估了技术对人类的影响。
