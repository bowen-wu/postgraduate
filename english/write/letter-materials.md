## Start


- Volunteers are needed for the International Conference on Globalization to be held on this campus in early July.<br>
- I have just arrived at my home from the airport. As I sit down at my desk, I just want to write a letter to you to thank you for your warm **reception** in the **cultural** exchange program. You and your family left a deep impression upon me. Indeed, the program is one of the most wonderful **memories** in my life.<br>
- I bought an electronic dictionary from your online store on January 1st, but after using it for a short period of time, I found it has some problems.<br>
- I am looking forward to my travel to the United States and visiting you in Harvard University.<br>
- As you know, I am extremely keen on the ancient Chinese novel-Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Now I am planning to direct a short play revised from it.<br>

- On behalf of the Students' Union of Beijing Foreign Studies University, I would like to extend our heartfelt welcome to all the overseas students who will study in our university.<br>
- On behalf of the "Talents" English Speech Contest committee, I am writing to invite you to serve as one of our judges.<br>
- We are greatly honored to welcome you as a guest professor at our university. I would like to recommend two scenic spots in our city: the Palace Museum and the Great Wall.<br>

- I'm glad to hear from you. How have you been these days? Since you're going to present an oral report on an ancient Chinese scientist, Bi Sheng is an ideal candidate.<br>
- I'm glad to hear from you. Thank you for your enthusiastic response to the event!<br>

## End

- Please give my best regards to your family.
- Once again, we sincerely hope you can be the judge for our competition.
- I hope you find the above recommendations useful. Looking forward to your successful presentation.
- Therefore, I would like either to change to another model that works better or a full refund. Your help is greatly appreciated.
- Please excuse me for not being able to inform you of my situation sooner. Your prompt attention to my suggestion would be highly appreciated.
- All in all, although there is a lot of pressure, the time you spend on our campus will be worthwhile and enhance your whole life. Hope you like it here.
- I hope you will have the opportunity to visit one or both of these spots. We wish you an enjoyable stay in our city.
- This event is going to be held in the Students' Recreation Center from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm on May 1, 2025. Could you please help me to write the letters of invitation to all the craftsmen? Looking forward to your support.
- Since you excel in acting, I cordially invite you to participate in the play and act as the leading hero, Zhuge Liang. I'm sure you will be quite interested in it. Looking forward to your reply.
